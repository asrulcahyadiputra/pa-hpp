What is Job Order Costing
###################

Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company's output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.)

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************
-Import database with the name "pa_hpp"
-Save the folder into htdocs
-If there is an error "mysqli :: real_connect (): access denied for user root @ localhost ....". Just go into the application / config / database.php folder and change the username and password. If using XAMPP, usually username = '' root 'and password =' '
